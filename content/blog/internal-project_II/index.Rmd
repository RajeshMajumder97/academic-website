## About ##

This is my B.Sc. final year project.

I did this project under the supervision of my mentor **Dr. Arabinda Das, A.P.C. College.**

In this project, I had worked on diet data, where I had studied that, how different diets actually affected weight loss.


***Keywords***:  *ANOVA*, *ANCOVA*, *Shapiro-Wilk Test*, *Kolmogorov-Smirnov test*, *Bartlett’s test*, *Levene’s Test*, *Tukey HSD test*.

Unfortunately, I am unable to give the data set and the code because, I have lost all the necessary documents regarding this project, due to a computer crash. But I am trying to do this again from scratch.
