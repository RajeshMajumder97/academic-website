<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is my B.Sc. final year project.</p>
<p>I did this project under the supervision of my mentor <strong>Dr. Arabinda Das, A.P.C. College.</strong></p>
<p>In this project, I had worked on diet data, where I had studied that, how different diets actually affected weight loss.</p>
<p><strong><em>Keywords</em></strong>: <em>ANOVA</em>, <em>ANCOVA</em>, <em>Shapiro-Wilk Test</em>, <em>Kolmogorov-Smirnov test</em>, <em>Bartlett’s test</em>, <em>Levene’s Test</em>, <em>Tukey HSD test</em>.</p>

Unfortunately, I am unable to give the data set and the code because, I have lost all the necessary documents regarding this project, due to a computer crash. But I am trying to do this again from scratch.
